# vr-activity-classification
Identifying user activities in a VR game using neural networks trained on network traffic data collected via Wireshark. The project involves analyzing features like packet count, inter-packet time, timestamps, and packet length.



# VR Activity Classification

This project aims to classify user activities in a VR game using neural networks. Network traffic data collected via Wireshark will serve as input, leveraging features like packet count, inter-packet communication time, timestamps, and packet length.

## Key Features
- Data collection using Wireshark on Meta Quest Pro.
- Neural network techniques (e.g., RNNs, Transformers) for activity classification.
- Focused on network traffic analysis in a VR environment.

## Project Goals
- Develop a dataset of VR network traffic.
- Train and evaluate different neural network architectures.
- Provide insights into activity classification from network data.

## Tools and Libraries
- Wireshark
- Python (TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
